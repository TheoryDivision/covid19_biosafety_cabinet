## Contents of this repository

- **data**: directory containing data on UV radiation at 9 different spatial positions in two different hoods. Data are organized as described in bsc_spatial.Rmd
- **bsc_spatial.Rmd**: An Rmarkdown file containing all of the code to produce the heat maps and summary statistic calculations.
- **bsc_spatial.html**: An html-rendered version of the corresponding Rmarkdown file
- **bsc_data.ipynb**: Some preliminary python analysis code
- **fig3.ipynb**: Calculations on survival of different pathogens over varying UV intensity and temporal analysis of our data
- **uv_record.py**: Code used to record the data.
- **n_95_variance.py**: Code that calculates variance of diode voltage over time.
- **PPE_UV_Manuscript.pdf**: Preliminary manuscript on this work
